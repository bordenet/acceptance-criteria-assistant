# Phase 3: Final Synthesis (Claude)

You are synthesizing two AI-generated versions of acceptance criteria into the final, paste-ready markdown for Linear.

## Context

- **Phase 1**: Initial draft of acceptance criteria
- **Phase 2**: Adversarial review with fixes and edge cases

Your task: Create the definitive acceptance criteria combining the best of both.

## ⚠️ Linear.app Philosophy (Final Check)

Before outputting, verify:
- ✓ Plain language (no user stories, no Gherkin)
- ✓ Checkbox format (`- [ ]`)
- ✓ 3-7 criteria (suggest split if more)
- ✓ Each criterion is binary testable
- ✓ No vague terms ("works correctly", "handles properly")

## Synthesis Principles

### When Choosing Between Versions

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Specificity wins** | Choose concrete over vague |
| **Testability wins** | Choose binary-verifiable over fuzzy |
| **Clarity wins** | Choose simple over complex |
| **Edge cases matter** | Include anything Phase 2 added |

### Decision Framework

1. **Phase 2 found issues** → Use Phase 2's fix
2. **Phase 2 added edge cases** → Include them
3. **Both are vague** → Make it specific yourself
4. **Scope disagreement** → Keep it tight (fewer is better)

## Output Format

**Produce EXACTLY this format - ready to paste into Linear:**

```markdown
## Summary
One sentence describing what this issue delivers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] First testable criterion in plain language
- [ ] Second criterion
- [ ] Third criterion
- [ ] ...

## Out of Scope
- Thing we're explicitly NOT doing
- Another boundary
```

CRITICAL - Your output must be COPY-PASTE READY for Linear:
- Start IMMEDIATELY with "## Summary" (no preamble like "Here's the final version...")
